# Qt version notes (for AI agents and humans)

**PJ4 builds against Qt 6.11.1.** Install it with [`../install_qt6.sh`](../install_qt6.sh)
(the single source of truth for the Qt version; it auto-selects the host arch).

> **Read this if your training data predates ~2025.** Qt 6.9, 6.10 and 6.11
> shipped *after* the knowledge cutoff of most current models. If you "know" PJ4
> is on Qt 6.8, that is stale — this file is the delta. Don't reach for a 6.8-era
> workaround for something later Qt fixed, and don't assume an API you don't
> recognize doesn't exist. When unsure about a Qt symbol, check the installed
> headers under `.qt/6.11.1/gcc_64/include/` rather than guessing from memory.

## Why 6.11 (a non-LTS) and not 6.12 LTS

We want the newest stable features now. 6.11.1 (released 2026-05-13) is the
latest stable; 6.11.2 isn't out until ~Aug 2026. The next **LTS** is **6.12**
(Qt's LTS cadence is now every 4th minor / ~2 years from 6.8 on, with 5 years of
support) — beta as of mid-2026, final ~autumn 2026. **Plan: ride 6.11.x now, then
settle on 6.12 LTS when it ships.** Qt 6 guarantees source/binary compatibility
across the whole 6.x series, so 6.8 → 6.11 → 6.12 is low-risk for a pure-Widgets
app like PJ4.

## Building on macOS (developer build, from the build tree)

v1 targets Linux, but the app builds and runs on macOS from the build tree for
development. The helper scripts branch on `uname` via
[`../platform_env.sh`](../platform_env.sh):

- **Qt install (aqt gotcha):** macOS uses `aqt install-qt mac desktop 6.11.1
  clang_64`, but aqt lays the (universal) build down in a folder literally named
  `macos` — so the install *arg* is `clang_64` while the on-disk folder is
  `.qt/6.11.1/macos`, unlike Linux where both are `gcc_64`/`linux_gcc_64`. When
  inspecting installed headers on macOS, look under `.qt/6.11.1/macos/include/`.
- **FFmpeg:** `conanfile.txt` forces the Linux-only `with_vaapi`/`with_libdrm`
  options; `build.sh` overrides them off on Darwin. Video decodes in software.
  VideoToolbox HW decode is a future opt-in (`ffmpeg/*:with_videotoolbox=True`)
  that `FfmpegDecoder` picks up at runtime with no C++ change.
- **`-Werror`:** relaxed to non-fatal on Apple Clang during bring-up (it surfaces
  diagnostics GCC doesn't); the full `-W…` set is still on. See root `CMakeLists.txt`.
- **The 3D view (`pj_scene3D`) is disabled on macOS for now.** Its renderer needs
  OpenGL 4.5 core + a compute shader, but Apple's OpenGL is frozen at 4.1 with no
  compute. `SceneViewWidget` detects this and shows an "unavailable" placeholder
  instead of the scene — the rest of the app (plotting, 2D scene, playback, data
  sources) works normally. The real fix is the QRhi/Metal backend port (planned).
  pj_scene2D already renders via QRhi and works on Metal today.

## What PJ4 actually uses (so you can judge relevance)

PJ4 is a **Qt Widgets** desktop app. It links Widgets, Core, Gui, Network, Xml,
OpenGLWidgets, Svg/SvgWidgets, Concurrent, UiTools, Charts, and **GuiPrivate**
(private headers — version-sensitive). It does **not** use QML / Qt Quick /
Qt Quick 3D, and **not** Qt Multimedia (video goes through FFmpeg directly).

Graphics split — important:
- **`pj_scene2D`** `MediaViewerWidget` is a **`QRhiWidget`** → it *does* go through
  Qt's RHI. QRhi changes can matter here.
- **`pj_scene3D`** renders with **raw `QOpenGLWidget`** (its own HDR FBO / SSAO /
  EDL / AgX passes), **not** QRhi. QRhi additions are latent for scene3D unless we
  ever port it.

## New APIs worth reaching for (added 6.9–6.11)

Prefer these over hand-rolled equivalents. Names are exact.

**Qt Core**
- `QPainterStateGuard` (6.9, in QtGui) — RAII `save()`/`restore()` for `QPainter`.
  Use it in paint code instead of manual save/restore (easy to leak on an early
  return). Relevant across `pj_plotting`, `pj_scene2D`, custom delegates.
- `QUuid::createUuidV7()` (6.9) — time-ordered (sortable) UUIDs.
- `QHash::tryEmplace()` / `insertOrAssign()` (6.9).
- `QSpan::chop()` / `slice()` (6.9); `QByteArray` implicit → `std::string_view` (6.10);
  `nullTerminate()`/`nullTerminated()` (6.10). Handy in `pj_datastore` / codec code.
- `QFuture::cancelChain()` (6.10) — cancel a whole continuation chain (`pj_runtime`,
  `Qt6::Concurrent`).
- `QThread::setServiceLevel()` / `QThreadPool::setServiceLevel()` (6.9) — OS QoS
  hints; candidate for the image-decode / ingest worker pools.
- `QRangeModel` (6.10) + `QRangeModel::ItemAccess` / `autoConnectPolicy` (6.11) —
  exposes `std::vector` / `std::array` / ranges as a `QAbstractItemModel` **for
  Widgets too**. Kills boilerplate in model adapters.
- `QSortFilterProxyModel::beginFilterChange()` / `endFilterChange(Direction)`
  (6.9/6.10) — cheaper, finer-grained than `invalidateFilter()` (which is
  deprecated for Qt 6.13+). Relevant to catalog/curve-tree filtering.

**Qt GUI / painting**
- `QPainterPath::setCachingEnabled()` / `trimmed()` (6.10).
- `QColorSpace` four-primary get/set (6.9) — useful for the scene3D HDR/AgX color
  management.
- `QImage::flipped()` / `flip(Qt::Orientation)` (6.9).

**Qt Widgets (item views — PJ4 has big curve trees / catalogs)**
- `QHeaderView` rewritten for **huge models** with much lower memory (6.9).
- `QAbstractItemView::updateThreshold` (6.9) — batch full-view updates above a
  row threshold instead of per-row repaints.
- `QAbstractItemView::keyboardSearchFlags` (6.11); `QComboBox::labelDrawingMode`
  = `UseDelegate` (6.9).
- `setSupportedDragActions()` on `QListWidget`/`QTableWidget`/`QTreeWidget` (6.10);
  `QAbstractItemDelegate::handleEditorEvent()` default (6.10) — relevant to the
  custom curve-tree drag-drop / delegates.
- `QDockWidget::dockLocation`, `QStackedWidget::widgetAdded()` (6.9).

**Qt Network** (marketplace / streaming paths)
- Per-request TCP keep-alive on `QNetworkRequest` (6.11; default idle close after
  2 min); `QSslCertificate::fromFile()` (6.10).

**QRhi** (matters for `pj_scene2D`'s `QRhiWidget`, not scene3D)
- D3D11/12 vblank watcher thread → lower CPU/latency (6.9); integer & depth
  texture formats (6.9); `QRhi::enumerateAdapters()` (6.10). Mostly Windows-side
  but the RHI path is shared.

## Deprecations & removals — act/avoid

- **Qt Charts is deprecated since 6.10** (migrate-to-Qt-Graphs messaging) and is
  **removed in Qt 7**. PJ4 **no longer depends on Qt Charts**: its one consumer,
  `pj_dialog_host`'s `ChartPreviewWidget`, was reimplemented on the vendored
  **Qwt** (`plotjuggler_qwt`); the dialog-protocol chart API (`setChartSeries` /
  `onChartViewChanged`) is unchanged. **Do NOT** reach for **Qt Graphs** as the
  replacement — its 2D path renders via Qt Quick Shapes / `QQuickWidget`, which
  would drag QML into a pure-Widgets module. Qwt (already used by `pj_plotting`)
  is the project's charting tool.
- **XRender X11 native painting engine removed (6.11)** — only relevant if built
  with `-xcb-native-painting`. PJ4 isn't; no action.

## Build / toolchain floors (don't trip on these)

- **CMake ≥ 3.22** required by Qt since 6.9. PJ4 keeps `cmake_minimum_required` at
  **3.22** on purpose — the Ubuntu 22.04 CI runner ships CMake 3.22.1, exactly at
  the floor. Don't bump the requirement past 3.22 (see the note in
  `.github/workflows/windows-ci.yml`); don't drop a runner below it either.
- **glibc floor raised 2.28 → 2.34** (6.10): official Linux Qt binaries (what
  `install_qt6.sh` fetches via aqt) are built on RHEL9. So a PJ4 binary built
  against them needs **glibc ≥ 2.34 (≈ Ubuntu 22.04+)** to run. Matters for
  *shipping* to end users, not for the dev box.
- **Private modules need their own component**: `find_package(Qt6 COMPONENTS
  GuiPrivate)` (6.10). PJ4 links `Qt6::GuiPrivate` — keep that in mind if you
  touch the find_package lines.

## Platform / Wayland behavior changes

- `wl_surface` lifetime now matches the window — it is **no longer destroyed when
  the window is hidden** (6.9). Safer hide/show of docks under Wayland.
- `xdg-toplevel-icon-v1` support (6.9) → `QWindow::setIcon()` actually shows the
  window icon under Wayland.
- Server-side decorations + server-side key repeat + `xx-session-management-v1`
  (6.11).
- **Not confirmed fixed:** the known PJ4 Wayland drag-and-drop "stuck on loading"
  cursor quirk isn't called out in any 6.9–6.11 changelog. Don't assume the
  upgrade resolves it; re-test.

## Explicitly NOT relevant to PJ4 (don't chase these)

QML / Qt Quick / Qt Quick 3D (incl. SSGI/SSR/motion vectors), Qt Multimedia &
the PipeWire backend, Qt WebEngine, Qt Canvas Painter, FlexboxLayout, Lottie /
VectorImage, Qt Graphs (the Charts/DataViz successor), Qt XR. These dominate the
6.9–6.12 headlines but touch nothing in PJ4 (pure Widgets + raw OpenGL + Qwt +
FFmpeg). scene3D's photorealism is hand-written OpenGL, *not* Qt Quick 3D.
